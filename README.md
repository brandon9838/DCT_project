# DCT_project
## Introduction   
This is the final project for the Special Project course. The target is to implement a 8*8 Discrete Cosine Transform unit in verilog and synthesize, P&R the circuit. The design is originally proposed in Ref_paper.pdf. The course material, DCT_detail.pdf, provides a more detail description about the design. In /weekly_meeting_ptt, I attach some design discussions with the course instructor in the weekly meetings. 
## Usage
For rtl-level simulation, in code/RTL:   
```
ncverilog DCT_test.v DCT_0531.v +access+r
```   
## TODOs
This project is not well documented.
Re-document the project in English.
