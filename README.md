# DCT_project
## Introduction   
This is the final project for the Special Project course. The target is to implement a 8*8 Discrete Cosine Transform Unit. The design is originally proposed in Ref_paper.pdf. The design details are described in DCT.pdf. 
## Usage
For rtl-level simulation, in src/:   
```
ncverilog DCT_test.v DCT_0531.v +access+r
```
